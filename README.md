# Enhanced HTML and CFML Package for Sublime Text 2

## Synopsis

This package is designed to provide rich HTML & CFML (Coldfusion) syntax colouring such as that seen in Adobe™ Dreamweaver™.

**Screenshots available at https://github.com/Siddley/Enhanced.HTML.CFML/wiki/Enhanced.HTML.CFML-Screen-Shots**

 * The "Dreamweaver (Classic)" colour scheme attempts to mimic the actual Dreamweaver™ look as accurately as possible.

 * The "Dreamweaver (Enhanced)" colour scheme incorporates some changes and enhancements to the classic look to better highlight embedded cf variables and functions while maintaining much the same feel.

 * Other templates (coming soon) are my attempt to use Ethan Schoonover's awesome solarized colour scheme to create a dark and light version with rich syntax highlighting similar to the Dreamweaver™ idea.
