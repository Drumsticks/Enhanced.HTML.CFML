# New Colour Themes are available #

_Thanks for using my color themes!_

I have just uploaded the Solarized (light and dark) themes so please try
them and see how you like them. I've been trying them out and I really
like the dark one.

Menu > Preferences > Colour Scheme > Enhanced HTML and CFML > ...

For more info about Solarized please visit <http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized>

I hope to have the CFBuilder colour theme ready soon.
